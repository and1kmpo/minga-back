# Minga backend app
_____________________BLUE TEAM__________________

This project is an API for reading and managing of comics and manga.

For the configuration of the server from the backend are used tools such as:   
Node js: execution environment
Express : framework to build the server
Mongoose: to query the MongoDB database

## How the server works?

this project works with **MongoDB** with the help of **Mongoose** library, **React** to develop our application interfaces as SPA and **Vite** which pre-configures everything you need to create our React app.

## What are its endpoints?
